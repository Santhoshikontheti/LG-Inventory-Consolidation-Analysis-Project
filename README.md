# 📊 LG Inventory Consolidation and Analysis Project

This project is a real-world data cleaning and consolidation task provided by Randstad/GULP on behalf of LG Electronics. The objective is to process inventory data from three different customers and produce a consolidated inventory report grouped by LG model and store-level granularity using Python.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

We received 3 Excel files from 3 different LG customers, each with varying column formats and data quality. The challenge was to:
- Clean, normalize, and unify column formats across datasets
- Detect and handle missing, duplicate, and inconsistent values
- Consolidate the inventory based on LG **Model**, **EAN**, and **Store**
- Export key summary files and identify missing critical data entries
- Provide visualizations for business decision-making
